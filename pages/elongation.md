# Elongation

All words can be written with any number of consecutive vowels or consonants and
still be correct.  For instance, the English word ladder:

 - `laedyr` / `ly'dyr` (no specific emphasis when spoken)
 - `laeddyr` / `ly'ddyr` (emphasize the 'd' sound)
 - `laedddyr` / `ly'dddyr` (really emphasize the 'd' sound)
 - `laeedyr` (drawn out 'a' sound)
 - `laeeedyr` (really drawn out 'a' sound)
 - `laedyrr` / `ly'dyrr` (drawn out 'r' sound)
 - `laedyrrr` / `ly'dyrrr` (really drawn out 'r' sound)
 - `ly'dieer` (drawn out 'e' sound)
 - `ly'dieeer` (really drawn out 'e' sound)

This can be useful for indicating tone.  The vowels with must be written in
their two letter form if they have one.
