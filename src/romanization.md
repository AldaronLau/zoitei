# Romanization

Before learning Zoitei, it's easier to learn with the latin alphabet.

There are two variants of Zoitei:

 - ASCII - only uses a-z and -
 - Unicode - adds ', ä, ë, ï, ö, ü, ÿ, č, ǧ, ȟ, ǩ, š, ž, þ, ŋ (removes q)

When using unicode, use “ ” (outer) and « » (inner) for quotation marks,
otherwise " (outer) and \` (inner).

 - I told them, "It's called \`zoitei (magic writing)\`, have you heard of it?"
 - I told them, “It's called «zoitei (magic writing)», have you heard of it?”

# Long Sounds

All words can be written with any number of consecutive vowels or consonants and
still be correct.  For instance, the English word ladder:

 - `laedyr` / `ly'dyr` (no specific emphasis when spoken)
 - `laeddyr` / `ly'ddyr` (emphasize the 'd' sound)
 - `laedddyr` / `ly'dddyr` (really emphasize the 'd' sound)
 - `laeedyr` / `lyy'dyr` (drawn out 'a' sound)
 - `laeeedyr` / `lyyy'dyr` (really drawn out 'a' sound)
 - `laedyrr` / `ly'dyrr` (drawn out 'r' sound)
 - `laedyrrr` / `ly'dyrrr` (really drawn out 'r' sound)
 - `laedyyr` / `ly'dyyr` (drawn out 'e' sound)
 - `laedyyyr` / `ly'dyyyr` (really drawn out 'e' sound)

This can be useful for indicating tone.
